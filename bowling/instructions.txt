The game consists of 10 frames as shown above.  In each frame the player has
two opportunities to knock down 10 pins.  The score for the frame is the total
number of pins knocked down, plus bonuses for strikes and spares.

A spare is when the player knocks down all 10 pins in two tries.  The bonus for
that frame is the number of pins knocked down by the next roll.  So in frame 3
above, the score is 10 (the total number knocked down) plus a bonus of 5 (the
number of pins knocked down on the next roll.)

A strike is when the player knocks down all 10 pins on his first try.  The bonus
for that frame is the value of the next two balls rolled.

In the tenth frame a player who rolls a spare or strike is allowed to roll the extra
balls to complete the frame.  However no more than three balls can be rolled in
tenth frame.


The kata is to build up a model for scoring games, and consume that model
within a series of unit tests. The tests in english are as follows.
The test and code should be evaluated often so that the simplest definition of 
each test is done and the code is modified to make that pass and then refactored.



First Test: Gutterball game.
Second Test: All 1 pins.
Third Test: 1 spare.
Fourth Test: 1 strike.
Fifth Test: Perfect Game.
